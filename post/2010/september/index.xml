      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, by some miracle and an inordinate amount of practice, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to recognise all the basic katakana. It&amp;rsquo;s still an insanely difficult task to translate works in katakana to english, with an assorted array of gotchas to catch you out. But it&amp;rsquo;s not different to English really&amp;hellip; probably simpler than English when you really think about it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a very long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve had to actually work at a subject. School had usually been easy, so having to practice regularly has been interesting. Next up will be learning to read hiragana, but I figure another week focusing on katakana will be more beneficial than trying to rush through too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m impressed that I have progressed this far. I was always being negative and telling myself it&amp;rsquo;s too hard. But with a handful of good and encouraging friends, and a neat little robot to quiz me at my whim, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to overcome the barricades I had placed in front of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
