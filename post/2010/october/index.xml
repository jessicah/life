      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was actually a few months ago that I discovered a song by a band I thought had disappeared as one of many, many one-hit wonders. And of all places, it was a j-pop music channel I had recently started frequenting that I rediscovered this band&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now, I&amp;rsquo;m still astonished that Hanson&amp;mdash;yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right, Hanson&amp;mdash;is still together, producing music, going on tours, and still have a very large fan base. And even more so that they have a song I actually like. Weird!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmG0DqhfDbY&#34;&gt;Thinking &amp;lsquo;Bout Somethin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s all &lt;a href=&#34;http://fieldsofmaize.com/morning/&#34;&gt;maiZe&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; fault that I watched this song and got hooked on it.&lt;/p&gt;
