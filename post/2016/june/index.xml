      <title>Feeling Cursed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling as if I&amp;rsquo;m cursed. It&amp;rsquo;s a feeling that&amp;rsquo;s been coming and going for quite a while now. Even carved it into my arm a couple weeks ago, although not very deeply&amp;mdash;will probably disappear completely fairly rapidly. It seems to be a mixture of rejection and inability to find a partner, and the psychological damage various churches have inflicted upon me over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;imagelink&#39; href=&#39;https://life.jessicah.org/post/cursed-original.jpg&#39;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could even call myself a Christian. There&amp;rsquo;s just too much in the Bible that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to mesh well with my world view these days. And then there are some parts that to me are complete fantasy. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to resolve the conflict of the Bible supposedly being infallible, and what I simply cannot believe is true. And then there&amp;rsquo;s this notion in my head that God really doesn&amp;rsquo;t like people at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the feelings of rejection&amp;hellip; after all the backstabbing that went on at various churches and ex-friends, I&amp;rsquo;m not quite as able to weather the storm of disappointment. I used to be strong-willed, confident, happy. I can see it in old photos of me. Now, I have anxiety and panic attacks, and get scared of going out and doing something new on my own, and often see things in a much more negative light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all makes falling in love a dangerous proposition, which is happening to me at present. Little things send my mind into an overwhelming spiral of negative emotions that snowball out of control. That&amp;rsquo;s how I ended up cutting. At least I didn&amp;rsquo;t go so far as to try committing suicide again. I guess that is one positive to cling to, to remind myself that I am getting stronger again. Baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;
