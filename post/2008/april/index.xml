      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s scary to see the damage of repressed emotions. In the last month, I came to the realisation that much of the problems in my relationship with my father were because of the events around my parents&amp;rsquo; divorce. And until that time, I never believed it had an effect on me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So sad. That&amp;rsquo;s fifteen years of putting up continual barriers against my dad, hurting him, and punishing him; much of it without really realising what was actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last Friday, I picked up the phone, and called him after walking out without even a goodbye just over a year ago. And it was a good small step towards repairing the rift between us. Conversation is still difficult, ant it will probably take a very long time to have a real father&amp;ndash;daughter relationship given how long it&amp;rsquo;s been without one at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the power and grace of God, I know the damage can be undone. And maybe one day if I ever get married, he&amp;rsquo;ll be able to give me away. That will be another dream to come true to add to my continually growing list!&lt;/p&gt;
