      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely never travelled as far and wide as I had last August. While not as big asn OE, still huge personally. My travels first led me to Portland, OR, then on to Victoria, BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Portland, I met &lt;a href=&#34;http://crazyhackerdude.livejournal.com/&#34;&gt;one of my best friends, Taras&lt;/a&gt;, of eight years, and his then-fiancee-now-wife in person for the very first time. And I, being my shy self, didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to break out of my shell very well. But I did meet a bunch of wicked cool people whom I hope to keep in touch with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also got to be there at Taras and Ellen&amp;rsquo;s beautiful wedding. The setting was perfect, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidhillwinery.com/&#34;&gt;David Hill Winery&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I had a high fever, so missed out on a lot of the night. But what I did manage to catch was definitely memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my favourite part of the whole trip? When Taras and I hugged in his hallway after getting back from the wedding and reception. Seems like such a silly thing, but it really touched me and made the whole trip worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
