      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just got the email with the race results for the Palmerston North Marist Cycling Club&amp;rsquo;s Road Champs. And what an ultimately fail way to win my division&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my division, the Senior Women, it was between me and one other girl. And she didn&amp;rsquo;t finish. So all I had to do was cross the finish line. What a truly suck way to win a club title. Out of everyone starting for the 3 laps, I came 7th our of 10 riders. Yeah, that club title definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, maybe next year I can do better and win the title more fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
