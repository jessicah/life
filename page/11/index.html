		<h2><a href="https://life.jessicah.org/post/2008/august/stuck/">Stuck</a></h2>
		<p>You may or may not know this about me, but I&rsquo;m a Christian. Presently, however, I&rsquo;ve found myself in a love-hate relationship with God that I&rsquo;m unable to break.</p>

<p>A while ago, I was struggling with other issues, when suddenly Psalm 139 started popping up everywhere, and one person had prayed it over me. That&rsquo;s when everything started to go more down hill&hellip;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s this one verse that is the cause of my relationship trouble with God. Psalm 139:13 reads &ldquo;For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother&rsquo;s womb.&rdquo; (NIV)</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into more personal details of my life, but basically I wasn&rsquo;t put together the way I should&rsquo;ve been, and for a verse like that to say that God did this to me hurts. It truly, deeply hurts. And now I hate God for how He put me together with a passion.</p>

<p>Yet, I still go to church; I still worship Him and sing His praises. Perhaps I don&rsquo;t mean it as much as I had been, but it&rsquo;s not a complete separation from God. Admittedly, I haven&rsquo;t read my Bible since, but I still talk to God and try to pray for other issues in my life, and other people and their situations.</p>

<p>I have noticed a lot of things going wrong lately though. A coincidence? Or is this the flak I get for hating God?</p>

		<h2><a href="https://life.jessicah.org/post/2008/june/flickr-fun/">Flickr Fun</a></h2>
		<p>After being convinced this afternoon to create a <a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> this afternoon after saying that I enjoy photography, I&rsquo;ve uploaded a couple photos taken with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95">Nokia N95</a>.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have many pictures at the moment, as I&rsquo;m really self-conscious about taking photos with people around. Silly, I know&hellip;</p>

<p>Most are prolly edited a lil&rsquo; too much, but it&rsquo;s all fun! Nice to have a distraction to keep me out of trouble, even if I should be working on one of my work projects.</p>

<p>Anyways, here are <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jessic4h">my pictures</a>.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://life.jessicah.org/post/2008/april/repressed-emotions/">Repressed Emotions</a></h2>
		<p>It&rsquo;s scary to see the damage of repressed emotions. In the last month, I came to the realisation that much of the problems in my relationship with my father were because of the events around my parents&rsquo; divorce. And until that time, I never believed it had an effect on me!</p>

<p>So sad. That&rsquo;s fifteen years of putting up continual barriers against my dad, hurting him, and punishing him; much of it without really realising what was actually happening.</p>

<p>But last Friday, I picked up the phone, and called him after walking out without even a goodbye just over a year ago. And it was a good small step towards repairing the rift between us. Conversation is still difficult, ant it will probably take a very long time to have a real father&ndash;daughter relationship given how long it&rsquo;s been without one at all.</p>

<p>By the power and grace of God, I know the damage can be undone. And maybe one day if I ever get married, he&rsquo;ll be able to give me away. That will be another dream to come true to add to my continually growing list!</p>
