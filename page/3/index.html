		<p>With the bright, low winter sun streaming through filtered glass into my very warm office, I had attempted to capture more vivid photos of the mini capsicums growing in abundance using a low exposure. Unfortunately, I completely overlooked the factor of which direction the camera was facing, producing extremely dark images than intended.</p>

<p>However, despite failed manual camera settings, the pictures turned out amazing, as seen in the following:</p>

</a></p>

<p>And here are a couple of other pictures before messing around with the camera settings:</p>

</a></p>

<p>I definitely like the under-exposed photos the best though :)</p>

<p>Strawberries, tomatoes, and perhaps some beans would grow well in this hothouse as well; would make for a beautifully lush and green working environment!</p>

		<h2><a href="https://life.jessicah.org/post/2010/june/drunken-stupor-take-two/">Drunken Stupor, Take Two</a></h2>
		<p>Last night, caught up with a cycling friend I haven&rsquo;t seen in some time, and managed to run into Raewyn briefly as well. Raewyn is off to follow the Tour de France with her husband and a few others for two months. Then my friend and I hit up a couple bars. I drank way too much, prolly eight pints worth. Had to lean against my friend as we walked back to the car. That eighth drink was devastating!</p>

<p>This morning, somehow I managed to drag self out of bed, almost couldn&rsquo;t stay standing in the shower; then packed and walked briskly with my bike to the bus station three blocks away, to catch the 9:20 to Wanganui to visit folks. And with the bike in tow to compete in the interclub individual time trial.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what possessed me to think I could do the time trial in my state; but I did it anyway. Some left over cold chicken helped line my stomach for a short while. And despite blustery winds, I managed to average 32km/h over the 25km course.</p>

<p>Still feeling a little ill. Really do need to learn to drink slower, and know my limits. I should also eat before going out too! Four pieces of toast just won&rsquo;t do&hellip;</p>

		<h2><a href="https://life.jessicah.org/post/2010/june/travels-down-south-intro/">Travels Down South: Intro</a></h2>
		<p>Once upon a time, not too long ago&mdash;February even&mdash;I embarked on a month long holiday, part of it to be enjoyed with my friends from the US, Taras and Ellen. We started in Wellington, where Taras was participating in some Linux conference, whilst Ellen and I explored parts of the city. And once conference was done, we all headed on down south to explore the wilderness that is the South Island.</p>

<p>We were on road bikes, loaded up with gear in panniers and backpacks, with no itinerary or plans. Everything was booked the night before, and very spur of the moment. We survived mostly on fish and chips, staying in backpackers everywhere we went.</p>

<p>After Taras and Ellen went their separate ways, I started to make a bit more use of public transport so I could cover more ground. Getting from one side of the South Island to the other, or from top to bottom, just isn&rsquo;t practical on a bike in the time I had. Eventually, I&rsquo;d like to go back again for six months, and explore at a slower pace with a much more awesome camera in tow.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an amazing and satisfying journey, although I was thoroughly exhausted towards the end of it all. Climbing on a fully laden road bike up some of those very long and winding hills takes its toll. But I made it, survived it, and took a whole bunch of pictures along the way.</p>
